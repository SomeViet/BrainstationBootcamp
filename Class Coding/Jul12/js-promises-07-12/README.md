 - Reference : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
 - The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
 - A Promise is in one of these states:
    - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    - fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    - rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
